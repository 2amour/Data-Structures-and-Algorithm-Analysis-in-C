Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Analysis-in-C
===========================================

A good book by Mark Allen Weiss.
I decide to make a review on this book and implement the data structures myself. Reinventing a wheel is important training.
Digesting CLRS might be too time-consuming, and inappropriate for a job-seeker. This book will be a proper substitute.
